# Newsletter Sign-up Form

This is my in-progress solution to the [Newsletter Sign-up Form challenge]

## Overview

The goal of this challenge is to create a responsive sign-up form for a newsletter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form should include an input field for the user's email address and a submit button. Upon successful submission, a success message should be displayed to the user.

## My Progress

So far, I have built the form using semantic HTML and styled it using CSS. I have also started working on the JavaScript portion of the challenge, but it is not yet complete. I have deployed my solution to [https://pour-moi.github.io/Newsletter_sign-up_form/], where you can see my progress so far.

## Feedback

I would love to hear any feedback or suggestions on how I could improve my solution. Feel free to leave a comment or open an issue on this repo.
